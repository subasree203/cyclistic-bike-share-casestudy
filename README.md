# cyclistic-bike-share-casestudy
The Cyclistic bike-share case study is a part of Google Data analytics professional certificate. 
All the data used in this project are from the public source https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
I have followed the ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act process. 
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that contain two set of users - 
        the casual who are non subscribers and 
        the members who are subscribed to the annual membership plan. 
The goal of the marketing team is to find a way to make the casuals subscribe to the membership plans.
They asked to find how the annual members and the casuals use cyclistic bikes differently.

I have used MS Excel to get the samples of the data from April-2021 to March-2022, 
R for binding, cleaning, calculating, visualizing the data,
and Tableau for further visualization.  
I have attached the R markdown document and tableau workbooks.
